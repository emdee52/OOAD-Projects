# OOAD Projects

## Names: Md Mahmud, Anand Odbayar

Used the code provided by Professor Burce Montgomery in Project2_FNCD.zip

Java version: 8

We assumed that all drivers could get injured and leave the FNCD unlike how other FNCD employees can quit one at a time for each type. Given how the race happens at the end of the day, we assumed that there wouldn't be reserved vehicles that can't be sold if they were going to participate in the race. One last assumption we made was that each race would consist of the one type of cars and the race wouldn't be a mix of cars like monster trucks and performance cars.

The UML has mostly been changed as we decided to use the Professor's code as a base point to start Project 3.2. This made the code much cleaner and also removed unnecessary and redundant methods. Also, added new fields for the FNCD class to implement the Observer class correctly.
