The updated UML contain some code additions. Primarily, new classes were added for the Factory pattern for both Vehicles and Staff class. We also had to add new methods and variables to the Buyer class to implement the command pattern. Some of the new Vehicle subclasses were renamed so it was changed to the correct ones in the UML diagram.
