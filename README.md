The UML diagram largely stayed the same in terms of the overall structure. The major changes from the diagram largely came from a trimming down of methods and variables. Although some of the upper classes got more variables but they were more used for tracking small things. Overall, the structure of the diagram stayed the same but there was a less variables and methods and more small variable trackers.

An assumption we made for the staff was the naming system. We assumed that there had to be a unique identifier given to each employee and it didn't need to be like an actual name like "John Smith." So we gave the employee ids instead. Another assumption we made was that opening day would always be Monday and not any other day. We also assumed that there couldn't be more than 3 employees of each type and that there would always be 9 employees total.
