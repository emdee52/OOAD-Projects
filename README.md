# OOAD Projects

## Names: Md Mahmud, Anand Odbayar

Java version: 8

The updated UML contain some code additions. Primarily, new classes were added for the Factory pattern for both Vehicles and Staff class. We also had to add new methods and variables to the Buyer class to implement the command pattern. Some of the new Vehicle subclasses were renamed so it was changed to the correct ones in the UML diagram.

Some assumptions we made about the project was that the user is already at a default FNCD on day 31. A possible error condition is if the user inputs something on day 31 that isn't a number then the program will break. We also assumed that the user wouldn't be able to choose what SalesPerson they get unlike how the vehicles work and will get a random person.
